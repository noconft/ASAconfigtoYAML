# ASA Config Parser

This project provides a Python script to parse Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) configuration files and export the parsed data to YAML format. It is especially useful for extracting and analyzing network objects, service objects, object groups, and access-lists (ACLs) from ASA configs.

## Features

- Parses network objects, service objects, and object groups
- Extracts and structures access-list (ACL) rules
- Converts ASA configuration into a structured YAML file for further processing or automation
- Easily extensible for more complex ASA config scenarios


## Customization

- The parser can be extended to support additional ASA configuration features.
- See `parse_ios.py` for the main parsing logic.
